# Scalable Broker utilities

Scalable Broker web app has no functionality to export transactions list,
so this is my attempt to get one :) 

## exportTransactions

Usage:
1. Navigate to https://de.scalable.capital/broker/transactions
2. Just copy and paste content of the scalable-broker.js in the development console of your browser
3. Save the CSV
