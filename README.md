# Scalable Broker utilities

The Scalable Broker web application does not have any functionality for exporting transaction lists,
so this is my attempt to get one :) 

## exportTransactions

Usage:
1. Navigate to https://de.scalable.capital/broker/transactions
2. Just copy and paste content of the scalable-broker.js into development console of your browser
3. Save the CSV
